# Family tree visualisation

This is a simple python app which takes a csv of family tree data and turns it into a D3 data visualisation 

I built this app to learn:
* Python
* Flask
* Jinja templates
* Git and GitHub

Next I want to learn how to:
* Deploy it to AWS
* Let a user upload a csv (at the moment it only accepts a local csv)
* Learn about the JavaScript for the D3 data visualisation so that I can add some features to is. 

The D3 data visualisation is based on [BenPortner's js_family_tree](https://github.com/BenPortner/js_family_tree)
